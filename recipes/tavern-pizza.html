        alt="A delicious looking pizza with cheese, marinara sauce, pepperoni, banana peppers, jalopenos, and basil leafs on top of a golden brown crust.">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Tavern pizza, the original Chicago-style pie, has a super thin, crispy crust with almost no rise. The toppings
        used here are a great combo of spicy and sweet — the pickled pepperoncini add a nice acidic balance to the
        pepperoni and cheese. Customize to your liking. Using a rolling pin to fully flatten the edges of the crust is
        different from how you would normally shape a pizza crust but this helps keep it thin. Add red chile flakes and
        Parmesan to finish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Dough</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons cold water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>cornmeal, for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Toppings</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup drained and sliced pepperoncini salad peppers, or to taste</li>
        <li>12 slices pepperoni, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 jalapeño pepper, seeded and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>hot honey, for drizzling</li>
        <li>coarsely chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <p>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a food processor and process until combined, about 3 seconds.
                With
                processor running, slowly pour cold water and oil through the food chute and process until dough forms a
                sticky ball that clears the sides of the bowl, 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>Lighly oil a work surface and set dough ball on top; knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough
                into a
                tight ball and place in a large bowl greased with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to
                rise
                at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a pizza stone on the lowest rack in the oven.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and gently re-shape into a ball. Coat dough ball
                lightly
                with flour and flatten into an 8-inch disk using your fingertips. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a
                12‑inch circle, dusting dough lightly with flour as needed.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Dust a pizza peel with cornmeal and transfer dough circle on top. Spread marinara sauce on dough,
                leaving a
                1/2-inch border around the edge. Top evenly with mozzarella, pepperoncini, pepperoni slices, and sliced
                jalapeño.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Carefully transfer pizza onto pizza stone in the preheated oven and bake until edges are golden brown
                and
                cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Remove from oven; drizzle with hot honey and sprinkle with basil.</li>
        </p>
    </ol>
