    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Tavern pizza, the original Chicago-style pie, has a super thin, crispy crust with almost no rise. The toppings
        used here are a great combo of spicy and sweet â€” the pickled pepperoncini add a nice acidic balance to the
        pepperoni and cheese. Customize to your liking. Using a rolling pin to fully flatten the edges of the crust is
        different from how you would normally shape a pizza crust but this helps keep it thin. Add red chile flakes and
        Parmesan to finish.
