    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 slices bacon</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 slices bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <p>
            <li>Place bacon in a nonstick skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly
                browned, about 7 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Remove bacon to a drip line tray. Drain
                off
                bacon grease for another use. Wash out the skillet.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Whisk eggs with salt and pepper in a small bowl until frothy.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs; let cook for 30
                seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes
                into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the
                top is set, about 3 minutes; reduce heat to low. </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Meanwhile, chop bacon roughly; sprinkle over omelet. Sprinkle with cheese; allow cheese to melt, 1 to 2
                minutes.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Meanwhile, butter 2 slices of bread with 1/2 teaspoon butter each. Lay bread, buttered side up,
                side-by-side over omelet, leaving about 1 inch between slices. The melted cheese will help the bread
                adhere.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Run a spatula around the entire omelet to loosen from the skillet. Carefully turn the omelet over so
                buttered side of bread is in contact with the skillet. Cook until bread is toasted and golden, about 2
                minutes.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Using the spatula, fold in edges of omelet to align with sides of the bread. Cut omelet along center
                with the spatula to form 2 sandwiches. Butter 2 remaining bread slices with remaining butter; place
                butter side up on each sandwich. Turn sandwiches; cook until golden, about 2 minutes more. Serve and
                enjoy immediately!</li>
        </p>
    </ol>
