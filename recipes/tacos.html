         sour cream, tomatoes, cheese, ground beef, lettuce, and a soft and hard shell with refriend beans inbetween.">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <P>The best tacos! A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, then wrapped around a hard shell taco, which is
        filled with seasoned ground beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and fresh guacamole.
        You can top it with whatever you like, but I recommend loading it up! Also, if you don't eat meat, put melted
        cheese on the soft shell, and the refried beans in the hard.
    </P>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refriend beans</li>
        <li>2/3 cup water</li>
        <li>12 prepared crisp taco shells</li>
        <li>2 avocados</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
        <li>1 fresh lime, juiced</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>12 (7 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <p>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco
                seasoning
                over the meat. Cook and stir the ground beef, breaking it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned and
                crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.</li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan, and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning
                packet. Heat the refried beans over low heat until simmering.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm
                them
                in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the
                lime
                juice, and salt and pepper to taste, and set aside.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2 tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap
                the
                tortilla gently around a crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef along the
                bottom of
                the crisp shell, and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the
                cheese with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop of sour cream and
                guacamole.</li>
