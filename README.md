# odin-recipes
My first website project for the Odin Project utilizing all the lessons shown so far.
-Creating the boiler-plate
-Adding a title to the window
-Using both ordered/unordered lists
-Using IMG to showcase pictures of the food. as well as inputting alt to ensure accessibility for images.
-Using bold, italic, and headline elements to stylize and put emphasis on keywords.
-Using attributes to index recipes and return to index from recipe pages.
-Using <p> (paragraph) to help space out instructions to increase readability.
